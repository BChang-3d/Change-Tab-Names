# Change-Tab-Names
Have you ever been playing a game, your parents come to check your tabs, you tab over, but the tab name still says "roblox"? You then get in trouble for playing games when you were working on homework. Now you can use this code to change the name and favicon (tab logo) to make it look like you are on google docs. 
# How To Use
copy each thing of code (the favicon changer and the text changer)
open a new tab
click the bookmark thing (the little star in the top right)
change the name if you want to
click more
change the URL to one of the codes
repeat the process except for the other one


**IF YOU PUT THE 2 CODES TOGETHER IN ONE BOOKMARKLET, IT WILL NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!! IT HAS TO BE SEPERATE BOOKMARKS!!!!!!!!!!**
once you put the bookmarks in, all you have to do is go to whatever game page, click the 2 bookmarklets then it should change the tab name and favicon.
